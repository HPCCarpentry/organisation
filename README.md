# HPC Carpentry

HPC Carpentry is an initiative to create and share training materials and curriculum for teaching skills needed to effectively use HPC resources for research. The primary audience of this teaching are researchers in different domains (but typically not computer science).


This repository is for storing documents, ideas, discussions about the organisation of the HPC Carpentry initiative.

There are at least three themes that HPC Carpentry would build on:
- Sharing course materials
- Training curricula for different users
- Outreach and raising awareness
- 
HPC Carpentry initiative is open to anyone who supports open science, open education and is keen to share their experiences, and hopefully, also trainig materials. Our main goal is to build a community similar to the one surrounding Software and Data Carpentry (and most likely our comminities will overlap, actually, they already do).

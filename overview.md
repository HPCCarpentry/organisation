### High Performance Computing Carpentry Overview

This document outlines the idea of HPC Carpentry training. This conceptual model has been started by Martin Callaghan (@callaghanmt) from Advanced Research Computing (ARC) at Leeds University. ARC offers [HPC training](http://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/) for the Leeds students and researc staff. 

#### Proposed training workflow:

##### 1. Motiovation - case studies
The training should start with introducting case studies to demonstrate the application and advantages of using HPC for research. The case studies could be roughly divided into two types:

* HPC for complex computatoional problems (*HPC for software*);
* HPC for large data problems (*HPC for data*).

### High Performance Computing Carpentry Overview

This document outlines the idea of HPC Carpentry training. This conceptual model has been started by Martin Callaghan (@callaghanmt) from Advanced Research Computing (ARC) at Leeds University. ARC offers [HPC training](http://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/) for the Leeds students and research staff.

The training should start with introducing case studies that are accessible to people from a wide range of research areas.

These examples should allow discussion of typical HPC uses cases:
* High Performance Computing
* High Throughput Computing
* Many Task Computing
* Big Data Analyses

1. An embarrasingly parallel problem, for example a parameter sweep data analysis using R and a suitably large data set.

2. A simple gridded finite element problem (ie. one where the problem is solved by processes communicating with each other). This introduces a problem that is best solved through parallelism.

3. A text analysis/ machine learning example using a sufficiently large data set (~ several GB, larger than might be stored in-memory on a typical desktop PC)

4. A bioinformatics example, such as multiple alignment or multiple current BLASTs

#### Proposed training workflow:

##### 1. Motiovation - case studies
The training should start with introducting case studies to demonstrate the application and advantages of using HPC for research. The case studies could be roughly divided into two types:

* HPC for complex computatoional problems (*HPC for software*);
* HPC for large data problems (*HPC for data*).

### High Performance Computing Carpentry Overview

This document outlines the idea of HPC Carpentry training. This conceptual model has been started by Martin Callaghan (@callaghanmt) from Advanced Research Computing (ARC) at Leeds University. ARC offers [HPC training](http://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/) for the Leeds students and researc staff. 

#### Proposed training workflow:

##### 1. Motiovation - case studies
The training should start with introducting case studies to demonstrate the application and advantages of using HPC for research. The case studies could be roughly divided into two types:

* HPC for complex computatoional problems (*HPC for software*);
* HPC for large data problems (*HPC for data*).

The suggested case studies would be:

|HPC for software | HPC for data|
|-----------------|-------------|
| Simple FE / GFD 'grid' parallel example (scaling).  | Bioinformatics data manipulation.|
| Text analysis; machine learning.  |Large scale data analysis in R (parameter sweep) |

These case studies is then used troughout the rest of the training to demonstrate how the end goal of analysing and breaking down the problem as well as writing parallelized algorithm, implementing it  and optimizing the code can be achieved.

##### 2. Why start using HPC?

This part of training focuses on comparing the use of HPC solutions to working on a typical desktop machine. It helps students understand:

* what type of problems are relevant for HPC;
* what HPC is in terms of both hardware and software;
* what skills they need to use HPC.

##### 3. Command line for HPC

This module teaches students basic to intermediate skills needed to operate in shell; which skills are also essential to work in HPC environments. It is particularily advised for students who only have used GUI environments to take this module. 

Students who already have intermediate knowledge of the command line can skip this module and move to the advanced module. 
A more advanced module on command line is available further down the training workflow. 
HPC Carpentry provides a self-assessment test allowing students to assess if they have the sufficient knowledge to skip a given module. 

##### 4. HPC Basics

This module teaches students some basic HPC concepts together with practical skills directly linked to these concepts. 

* Batch scheduler
* Data transfer
* HPC hardware architecture basics.

##### 5. HPC Workflow management

##### 6. HPC Hardware



##### 7. Metrics
